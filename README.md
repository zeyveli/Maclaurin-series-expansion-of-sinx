# Maclaurin-series-expansion-of-sinx
This repo contains the MATLAB code for the calculation of Maclaurin series expansiyon of sinx. It first takes **n** as the number of significant figures that is required to calculate and uses this value to find the error tolerance. Then takes **x** as the sine input and calculates the expansion using a **while** loop.

The Maclaurin series expansion for sinx is like:
